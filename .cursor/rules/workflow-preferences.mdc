# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the pattern and architecture of how a feature works, after is has shown to work well, unless explicity instructed
- Always think about what order methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
